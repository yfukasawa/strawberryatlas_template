  We performed a differential gene expression analysis using leaf-derived RNA-seq datasets to compare the Hawaii-4 and Yellow Wonder accessions.
  Because this analysis employed a different methodology from the TPM-based approach described above, the results are presented as log2-transformed fold-changes.
